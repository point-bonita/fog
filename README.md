# Summary

What is the difference between state socialism and state liberalism? It is not power versus liberty. It is the presumption of power against the presumption of liberty.
... and not just a pro-forma presumption, but one which is effectively buttressed

>In Europe charters of liberty have been granted by power. America has set the example... of charters of power granted by liberty.
James Madison - Charters
in Letters and Other Writings of Madison, IV, p 467
